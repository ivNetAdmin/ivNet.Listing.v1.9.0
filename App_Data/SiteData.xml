      Lime Trees and Beech Wood are two self catering houses on the edge of Stoke-on-Trent. A great place to stay if you are working in the local Theatres. We've had very good reviews from people working at The New Vic and The Regent. All who stay are so happy to find a haven, close to work, pubs, shops etc .... somewhere special. We have lots of people returning to stay here. The houses are off the main road down a track. Just peaceful, comfortable houses, surrounded by nature; everything you could need is provided from wifi to films to watch.

      Each house sleeps six in three bedrooms. Both have a downstairs toilet, dish washer, washing machine and well equipped kitchen. There is plenty of off road parking and a lovely large garden to enjoy. Along the Caldon Canal is a wonderful new cycle path, also great for walking and running.

      We are also close to the beautiful Market Town of Leek on the edge of The Peak District. Buxton is only half an hour away, as is Alton Towers if you are feeling like excitement on days off!

      The houses have a four star accreditation from Visit England, also the Staffordshire Environmental Quality Mark. They are set in a 20 acre nature reserve.....wild flower meadows, bluebells growing in an oak wood and just on front is the beautiful Caldon Canal.

      This delightful two-bedroom first floor flat is situated in the popular, bohemian area of Morningside, with direct, frequent bus links into the city centre, as well as access to lots of local amenities, including the Dominion Cinema and Churchill Theatre.

      The accommodation features 2 very spacious double bedrooms, plus a box room adjoined to the master bedroom. The master bedroom is beautifully furnished with a dark teak bedframe, side tables and chest of drawers. The second bedroom, at the rear of the flat, has a double bed, wardrobe, sofa bed and side table, and looks out onto the shared garden. There is an additional sofa bed if you want to accommodate more people.

      There is a large kitchen/diner/lounge to the rear, with a fully fitted stylish red kitchen, comfy sofa, TV, DVD player, dining table with four chairs and a large utility cupboard for extra storage. There is free Wi-Fi throughout the property. The kitchen has all facilities and equipment you might need, including gas hob, electric oven, washing machine, microwave, kettle and fridge-freezer. The property has a gorgeous bathroom, with a unique curved shower/bath, WC and basin.

      When staying at the property you will have easy access to a wide range of fashion boutiques, artisan food shops, independent stores, delicatessens, grocers, cafÃ©s and award-winning restaurants in the local area, not to mention a number of cosy, traditional pubs, both in Morningside and the adjacent neighbourhood, Bruntsfield. A full guide to the area is included in the property. There are also plenty of high street retailers nearby, including Marks &amp;amp; Spencer, Sainsburyâ€™s, Waitrose and Boots. You can also order home delivery from all major supermarket chains straight to your door.

      Buses 5, 11, 15, 16 and 23 stop directly outside the front door of the flat meaning you can get to the city centre and train stations quickly and easily. You can also reach Edinburgh Airport via the City Bypass road in only 20 minutes. A relaxed stroll into town across the green parklands of Bruntsfield Links and The Meadows gives you the chance to admire Edinburgh Castle, the breathtaking Arthurâ€™s Seat (the highest point in Edinburgh) and other famous sights.

      Please note:

      â€¢ Linen and towels are provided.

      â€¢ No pets are allowed and the entire flat is non-smoking.

      â€¢ If you require a pram, travel cot or high chair, we can provide these items at no extra cost. Please request when booking.

      â€¢ Since the photographs above/below have been taken, the master bedroom has been repainted to a neutral colour.

      Room to rent. It's in a two-bed flat in the Tulse Hill estate, just opposite Brockwell Park. It's less than 15-minute walk to Brixton underground and ten minutes to Herne Hill train station. There are ample of night buses that get you back home at anytime.
      There's free parking in front of that flat. The room has a double bed, wardrobe and drawers and a quaint Victorian fireplace. You have access to a large living-room and separate kitchen. Thereâ€™s a large fridge/freezer and washing machine/dryer in the kitchen. There's a bath and shower in the bathroom and the toilet is separate on its own. The flat is on the third floor of a block of flats and backs onto the lawns of the estate, so thereâ€™s very little road noise. If rented by the week, the rent is Â£145 per week which includes all bills.
      The flat is a two-minute walk from the lovely Brockwell Park, which has an outdoor swimming pool, walled garden and outdoor films and theater in the summer. A walk across the park gets you to the Herne Hill farmers market every weekend and just a short walk from the flat is Ritzy cinema, Brixton Academy and hundreds of nice eateries in Brixton Market.

    <post_content>I have a spare room available in a two bed flat in West Didsbury, Manchester. From the balcony, you look out over Burton road and its metrolink stop, which takes less than a minute to walk to! The room has a double bed, wardrobe, chest of drawers and a mirror. I do have house rabbits and although they aren't allowed in the spare room, they might venture into the shared lounge so if you have any allergies, this might not be for you. I used to be an actor myself before I got into the writing side of things so hopefully I'd make a good temporary flatmate too! Feel free to email me for photos.</post_content>

      There are 4 rooms available and each has its own free-view television, alarm clock radio with ipod docking station and storage space.
      &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Room 1 â€“ small single room (Â£75 per week or Â£10.71 per night)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Room 2 â€“ small double room (Â£85 per week or Â£12.14 per night)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Room 3 â€“ large room with superking size bed. (Â£95 per week or Â£13.57 per night)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Room 4 â€“ very large room with double bed. (Â£95 per week or Â£13.57 per night)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;/ul&gt;
      If you want to rent the whole house the cost is simply the addition of the above so Â£350 a week or Â£50 a night.

      The house is a large semi-detached property based 4.5 miles outside of the city centre in the residential suburb of Farnley. It is has been recently refurbished and includes 4 bedrooms and shared communal space of a bathroom (bath &amp;amp; power shower), fully equipped kitchen with all mod cons, a large inviting lounge, dining room, small conservatory and enclosed garden with picnic table. The property is centrally heated with broadband wi-fi throughout and there are laundry facilities, plenty of storage and a secure motorbike shed for bike storage in the garden. Digs can be booked on a room by room basis or you can rent the entire house if you prefer.

      Nomad Digs is located on the dual carriageway ring road of Leeds so it is very easy to find if you are arriving by car and Sat Nav should bring you right to the door but directions can be provided if necessary. There are 2 secure parking spaces in the rear garden of the house and 2 parking spaces on the road.

      The house is 4.4 miles to the centre of Leeds and 6.1 miles to the centre of Bradford.

      If you are working in the city centre of Leeds and need public transport there is a bus stop about 200 metres from the front door and the No.4 is the regular service to the centre of Leeds. The last return bus in the evening is around 11.15pm and bus timetables can be provided on arrival.

      If you are heading to Bradford it is a swift commute by car and there is a train station about 1 mile away which will take you to Bradford centre.

      There are lots of local amenities near the house and within 200 metres you will find a Sainsburyâ€™s local, a pharmacy, 2 chip shops, a McDonalds, a Subway, a Greggs, a post-office, laundrette, hair dresser, local Heron foods supermarket and a DIY superstore. Within 300 metres towards the back of the house you can find Post Hill, a lovely wooded area for country walks and fresh air. About 1 mile away (on the bus route) is also a municipal leisure centre with gym, classes and a swimming pool. Also about 1 mile away is a large Morrisons supermarket.

      Comfortable double-bedded room in sizeable, friendly and well-located family home.
      This spacious room is furnished with double wardrobe, desk, armchair, table and its own television (with freeview).Â  Shared use of two bathrooms (one with shower, one with bath).Â  Rent includes all utilities (including wi-fi), use of washer/dryer as well as large, fully equipped modern kitchen. Bedding and towels are provided.Â  Small south-facing garden and recliner chairs to use if ever we get the appropriate weather!
      The house is very conveniently located in Didsbury, about 4 miles south of the city centre, and very close to all major bus, tram and train routes into town. Parking is available in drive or on road.
      I am a teacher and share the house part of the time with my son who is in his gap year - working part time and studying to improve his A level grades.Â  My other son is at Uni and comes back for the odd week during vacations. Both lads are members of the National Youth Theatre, so we are a theatrically-sympathetic family!

      I have a lovely double room to rent in my house in Old Trafford.
      The house is great great, a comfortable sitting room, new kitchen, and a huge bathroom!
      It is near a main bus route into town, a taxi into town is about Â£6. It is also near Trafford Bar Tram stop, there is parking.
      I ride a bike and can ride into town in 15mins.
      It is 2.2 miles from the Royal Exchange, and 3 miles from the Lowry.
      There are plenty of shops near by, and some great take-aways!
      There is a good park to go for a stroll, and the area is great, a real community.
      I work from home, but you are welcome to use the communal areas (sitting room and kitchen) as and when you need.

      &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: #990000;"&gt;MORE DETAILS &amp;amp; FACILITIES:
      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;There are several self-catering options available which will make the per person cost very reasonable.Â  The property has large gardens overlooking the RSPB reserves.Â  Fabulous views and very private.Â  Quiet yet convenient.Â  There is no impact on neighbours for those wishing to practice in the daytime.Â  The accommodation is good quality and very comfortable.Â  All units are graded by the tourist board and range from three stars upwards.

      AllÂ &lt;strong&gt;towels, linen and heating&lt;/strong&gt;Â are provided.Â  There areÂ &lt;strong&gt;televisions&lt;/strong&gt;Â in some of the bedrooms andÂ &lt;strong&gt;Sky TV&lt;/strong&gt;Â in communal rooms. Some rooms areÂ &lt;strong&gt;ensuite&lt;/strong&gt;.Â Â &lt;strong&gt;Smoking&lt;/strong&gt;Â is allowed in some of the accommodation.Â  There isÂ &lt;strong&gt;wireless internet connection&lt;/strong&gt;Â in some areas.Â  TheÂ &lt;strong&gt;kitchens&lt;/strong&gt;Â are fully equipped and the cottages have automaticÂ &lt;strong&gt;washing machines plus dryer or line&lt;/strong&gt;.Â  There is aÂ &lt;strong&gt;resident dog&lt;/strong&gt;Â on the premises.Â  There is no curfew and your latest time of departure on the last day is 11am.

      Fir Tree House at Valley View is just one of the self-catering options.Â  Refurbished and furnished to a high standard it combines the comfort of a home from home with spectacular outdoor views and extensive garden areas.Â  For those with a more `adventurous` nature, the grounds attach to miles of riverside and mountain walks via the Cwm Clydach Nature Reserve.Â  However, don`t feel that a stay at Fir Tree will have you isolated in any way as, although semi-rural and quiet, it is just 15 minutes from the centre of Swansea and just 10 minutes from the M4 motorway.Â  Walking, fishing, riding, golf and a host of other activities are on the doorstep.

      &lt;strong&gt;Actors working at the Grand Theatre Swansea rated this accommodation highly.&lt;/strong&gt;

      Helpful onsite hosts.

      &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: #990000;"&gt;TRANSPORT:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
      A bus runs from outside the door to Swansea Central.Â  Transport can often be arranged at a reduced cost in the evening.

      Approx. night-rate taxi fare back is Â£15-20.

      There isÂ &lt;strong&gt;private parking&lt;/strong&gt;Â available.

      &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: #990000;"&gt;Local amenities:
      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Shops and takeaways etc 2 miles.Â  Pub with fab food, generous helpings and very reasonable!Â  We can book for you.

Vacuum available if requested.

      There areÂ &lt;strong&gt;two resident dogs&lt;/strong&gt;Â on the premises.

      Located on a working farm in the quiet village of Wootton Green, The Stable Yard offers the luxuries of a Hotel with the flexibility and tariffs of self- catering, allowing you to relax and unwind from a busy day at work, or whilst enjoying a holiday or short break. Our apartments have been sympathetically converted from a former coach house, with many of the original features remaining. The decor is contemporary and stylish and the apartments have all of the conveniences of modern living. Unlike many self-catering properties, it is possible to stay at The Stable Yard from 1 night (subject to time of year) to several months.

      We have 8 apartments in total (1 split level, 7 studio style) making this a perfect getaway for a group of family or friends.

      There is a pub within walking distance and if you feel like a night off from cooking, there is a good selection of pubs and restaurants in the surrounding area. Or simply relax in your luxury accommodation and make use of the local fast food delivery options also available.
      We are located just off J13 of the M1 between Bedford and Milton Keynes. We have easy access to Cranfield, Bedford, Milton Keynes, Ampthill, Brogborough, Kempston, Woburn, and Stagsden. Approx 2 miles from the A421 and 45 minutes from London via Thames Link. Milton Keynes offers the Xscape Centre, shopping in Central Milton Keynes and the Milton Keynes Theatre.

    <post_content>&lt;p&gt;2 double bedrooms in spacious 3/4 bed house. The rooms both have wardrobes, a desk and shelving, a double bed, tea and coffee making facilities, a hairdryer and an ipod dock. The house is 5 mins from Wood Street overground (12 mins to Hackney, so great for the Hackney Empire and 17 mins to Liverpool Street so handy for the Barbican, Mermaid Theatre etc), 12 mins walk to Walthamstow Central (20 mins into the West End) and a short bus ride to Stratford (so handy for the Theatre Royal and Stratford Circus). I'm a musician (sax and flute player), so I have experience of staying in digs myself! In the surrounding area there's plenty to do. Walthamstow village is just 5 mins walk with it's lovely bars, cafes, delis and pubs and 5 mins the other way is the beginning of Epping forest with nice walks and a boating lake. The area is vibrant and is home to lots of musicians, actors and artists.&lt;/p&gt;</post_content>

      A traditional stone barn, sympathetically converted to a high standard to offer private accommodation for one/two people. Situated in Chelmorton, 6 miles from Buxton, it offers an excellent quiet base for Buxton Opera House.

      South facing, the property is approached by a tree lined walled pathway, which leads to a private flagged and walled patio area, with garden furniture. The attractive kitchen dining/lounge area, with wooden floor and oak beams, has a comfortable seating area with television. An archway leads though into the bedroom, with double bed and en-suite shower room (electric shower, hand basin and toilet).

    <post_content>I have a double-bedded room in a large, first-floor flat in central Aberdeen near Old Aberdeen. The room is large (10'x12') with plenty of storage space. The flat has a single bathroom with gas-fired combie boiler so there is always hot water and good pressure. There is a spacious, well-equipped kitchen as well as a large lounge. There is satellite TV (and wifi throughout the flat) in the lounge and the kitchen. Linens and towels (washing machine and tumble dryer also available) are provided but not breakfast. The flat is non-smoking and quiet after 10pm. The flat is on main bus routes and the city centre is a 15-minute walk down George St (one of Aberdeen's main streets). Payment per week is expected at the end of each week. Call in evenings (01224 642567) - there is an answer phone however so it is possible to leave details at other times.</post_content>

      Double room in beautiful flat in converted Victorian house just next to the Town Hall in Liverpool. Decorated in what we would call "grandma chic" - a mix between antiques and modern finds.

      Residents both work in the arts; musician and actor/director/DJ - both festival organisers and promoters.

      The bed is an IKEA sofa bed with a top mattress. Quite comfortable and good for sofa use daytime as well. The room has a free desk space, mirror and drawers for clothes.

      Breakfast and evening meal can be included for an extra Â£5/day as avid cooks.

      Laundry services available, flat fee Â£2 per wash.

      Guests allowed with notice

      One single bedded room for rent in a terraced house with live in landlady.

      Only 1.3 miles to the theatre. (Approx 6mins by car)

      The bedroom has a wardrobe, chest of draws, shelving units, mirror &amp;amp; desk. Use of fully equipped kitchen, living areas and bathroom shared with owner. There is also a good sized garden with space to store a bike.

      Full Description:

      The house is a terraced town house, decorated in a funky but rustic way with modern touches and facilities. It sits just outside of the student area, on a residential street with trees and greenery at one end. I am a live in landlady and I work from home as a vocalist and songwriter.

      The spare room is clean and fresh. There is a single bed, a wardrobe and a chest of drawers. I also have a couple of shelving units in there, a mirror and a desk which can be left in the room or removed depending on what is desired or required.

      I have two reception rooms, I work in the back one and am happy to share the front room. This room is comfy and cosy, there is a TV with Virgin media and DVD player, a sofa and big sofa chair, a table that two can eat at and a big bookcase of books. A working fire too.

      The bathroom is to a high standard and clean. There is a bath and a shower.

      The Kitchen is well equipped with a fridge/freezer, an oven and grill, a sandwich maker, a microwave, a toaster, a kettle and a washing machine.

      The garden is a really good size with seating areas which anyone renting a room is welcome to enjoy.

      There is room in the secure garden to store a bike with a cover.

      Beautiful big gothic/arty converted pub, self catering, in vibrant village of Alton, 25 mins drive from Regent Theatre, Stoke on Trent.
      5 large bedrooms (and another separate sleeping area on landing). Lots of communal space downstairs and private garden.
      Used as holiday let, but happy to offer reduced rates for touring performers.
      Â£24 per person per night for up to 6 - room each. Â£15 per person for bigger groups if needing to share rooms (can accommodate up to 12). Any days of the week, for any number of nights, subject to availability.
      Alton is a beautiful hilly village at the edge of the Peak District with fantastic walks. There are 2 great pubs and best restaurant in the area on the same street as the property. Late opening shop and post office at the end of the road...and Splash Landings water park and Spa 2 mins away... Buses to Stoke from the end of the road (although as we all know, the rural transport system tends to run at a very different timetable to anybody's needs!)
