      Lime Trees and Beech Wood are two self catering houses on the edge of Stoke-on-Trent. A great place to stay if you are working in the local Theatres. We've had very good reviews from people working at The New Vic and The Regent. All who stay are so happy to find a haven, close to work, pubs, shops etc .... somewhere special. We have lots of people returning to stay here. The houses are off the main road down a track. Just peaceful, comfortable houses, surrounded by nature; everything you could need is provided from wifi to films to watch.

      Each house sleeps six in three bedrooms. Both have a downstairs toilet, dish washer, washing machine and well equipped kitchen. There is plenty of off road parking and a lovely large garden to enjoy. Along the Caldon Canal is a wonderful new cycle path, also great for walking and running.

      We are also close to the beautiful Market Town of Leek on the edge of The Peak District. Buxton is only half an hour away, as is Alton Towers if you are feeling like excitement on days off!

      The houses have a four star accreditation from Visit England, also the Staffordshire Environmental Quality Mark. They are set in a 20 acre nature reserve.....wild flower meadows, bluebells growing in an oak wood and just on front is the beautiful Caldon Canal.
